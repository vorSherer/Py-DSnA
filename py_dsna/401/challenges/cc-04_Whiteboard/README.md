# Interview 01
Given a matrix, find the sum of each row.

## Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. <br>
Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate a code challenge <br>
Score the candidate according to the Whiteboard Rubric <br>
You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond), but don’t solve it for the candidate <br>

## Feature Tasks
Ask the candidate to write a function to add up the sum of each row in a matrix of arbitrary size, and return an array with the appropriate values. <br>
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language. <br>
Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays. <br>
The matrix will always be full of integers. <br>
Negative values are possible. <br>
All nulls will be counted as zeros. <br>

## Structure
Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview. <br>
Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available. <br>
Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to at least convince you that their code works to solve the problem. <br>
Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill. <br>
Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. <br>

## Example
__Input__ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - __Output__ <br>
[ [1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 7], [1, 7, 10] ]	__[6, 15, 18]__ <br>
[ [0, 1, 5], [-4, 7, 2], [-3, 12, 11] ]	__[6, 5, 20]__ <br>
The candidate should draw the input and output as a square of integers. <br>

## Documentation
Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete. <br>

#### My Submitted Comments:
"I feel my interviewer was more lenient with me than necessary. While I appreciate his graciousness, I would have scored myself lower in several areas. My use of time was impacted by my unfamiliarity with matrices in coding. No way to go but up!" <br>
