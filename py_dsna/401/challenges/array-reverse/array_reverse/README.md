# Reverse an Array
Code challenge 1

## Challenge
Write a function called reverse_array which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used a slice approach with a -1 step to load a new array and returned the new array.
Big O = O(n) <br>
[My code is here](array_reverse.py)
