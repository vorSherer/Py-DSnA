# FIFO Animal Shelter
Implementation of a First-In-First_Out animal shelter for dogs and cats.

## Challenge
#### Feature Tasks <br>
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. <br>

Implement the following methods: <br>
__`enqueue(animal)`__: adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object. <br>
__`dequeue(pref)`__: returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return __*null*__. <br>

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- Both Stack and Queue were implemented using a singly linked list methodology. <br>
__Big O space__ for each will be __O(n)__ and <br>
__Big O time__ for each operation is __O(1)__. -->

## API
<!-- This implementation has access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class. -->

## Solution
My code is [here.](./fifo_animal_shelter.py)
