# Binary Search of an Array
Given a list and a value to be used as a search key, use a binary search methodology to determine whether the search key value exists in the array.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
